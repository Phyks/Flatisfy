## What happens when duplicates are detected across different backends?

There is a default precedence defined for each backend. This should be defined
so that the backend with highest precedence is the backend that should contain
the most precise information usually.

When deduplicating, the post from the backend with the highest precedence is
kept and missing info is taken from the duplicate posts (precedence is used so
that in case of conflicts in a field, the data from the backend with highest
precedence is used). This post contains as much data as possible, and includes
references to all the other "duplicate" posts. These latter duplicate posts
are then simply marked as such and never shown anymore.

All origins are kept in a `urls` field in the remaining post.
