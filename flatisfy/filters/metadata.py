        This function works by removing any fancy character from the ``query``
        and ``choices`` strings (replacing any non alphabetic and non numeric
        characters by space), converting to lower case and normalizing them
        (collapsing multiple spaces etc). It also converts any roman numerals
        to decimal system. It then compares the string and look for the longest
        string in ``choices`` which is a substring of ``query``. The longest
        one gets a confidence of 100. The shorter ones get a confidence
        proportional to their length.
